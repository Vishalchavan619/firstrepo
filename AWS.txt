*AWS users :
There are 2 users in AWS,
1.Root user. 2.IAM user.

*ROOT ACCOUNT :
1.Used for multiple access in an organization.
2.known as IAM user (identity access management users).
3.it provides limited permissions, Administrator is a head of users which have more permissions,but the whole persmissions        are under root user.
4.Administrator user also don't have permission of payment access/details.   
5.Root user can customize permissions.
6.IAM is globel serice(can access in any regine).
7.IAM user contain @ in its user name, and Root user dont contain @ in it.

*S3 : used to store data.

*MFA : multi factor authentication.
*Service models :
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a mix of 
1.infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), 
2.platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and 
3.software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud computing services.

*AWS users :
There are 2 users in AWS,
1.Root user. 2.IAM user.

*ROOT ACCOUNT :
1.Used to create a multiple IAM users under the single root user.
2.known as IAM user (identity access management users).
3.it provides limited permissions, Administrator is a head of users which have more 
  permissions,but the whole permissions are under root user.
4.Administrator user also don't have permission of payment access/details.   
5.Root user can customize permissions.
6.IAM is globel serice(can access in any regine).
7.IAM user contain @ in its user name, and Root user dont contain @ in it.

*Hypervisor / Virtualization : 
1.It is layer between OS and applications running on it.(VM-virtual machine)
2.hypervisor is used to run any OS ,that's why any os is supportble.
3.Every VM has its own OS , and there is also a host/base OS which runs all different types of
  os on it with the help of hypervisor layer.

*ROLE:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*EC2

*INSTANCE :
-Three are three types of instance
1.ON demand instance
2.Reserved instance
3.Spot instance

*KEY PAIR:
 While creating key pair we get Private key ,and public key is already present 
 at the instance ,If both the key's are match than only we got access.

*SECURITY GROUP :
Use to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20/11/2024

*Connecting to server:
*If we created Linux base Instance we get .ppk putty file private key to connect to 
 AWS instance.
*If we create windows base instance we just .pem file private key, we just connect it 
 to the AWS instance by decryption of private key and we get our password ,which is 
 used to access in  Remote Desktop Connection (RDC).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21/11/2024
 
*Elastic Ips: 
1.WE can reserve / fixed a IP address by creating elastic IP .
2.A reserve IP is associate to any instance which mean IP of that instance is fixed.
3.If we create elastic IPs and not associate to any instance AWS will charge us for 
  that IPs, which we have server & not associate.

creating AMI
image /snapshot
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28/11/2024

*VOLUME
1.EBS :elastic block storage 
2.Network settings :we can select region as per requirement.
3.Data availability : multiple copies are available at AZ .
4.Data persistence : 
5.DAta encryption : WE can encrypt the data .
5.Data security : it will delete disk/volume when we delete our server/instance .
*7.Snapshot : used for backup but it need to snapshot before ,without snapshot we 
  can't get backup. charges will be apply for snapshot.(snap shot is like a copy of
  data)
8.flexibility : 
*9.IOPS (input output per second):it is unit of measuring disk/storage performance. 
10.Throughput : 
11.EBS volume type :
   1)General purpose SSD  : medium size database cost friendly 
   2)Provisioned IOPS SSD : very high value of IOPS it may cost heigh(fast ip op).
   3)Throughput optimized HDD : used to story heigh rate of data heigh cost.(B-Data)
   4)cold HDD : used to story data in heigh rate ,it is low cost than throughput
     HDD ,also low performance than it.

*Adding disk to windows 
*image : used to create image which is a copy of instance .
*snapshot is a copy of disk.(incremental snapshot & full snapshot)
*running HTML code/file on server :
 1.First we have to install httpd package .
 2.we have to save our runnable index.html code/file in ( /var/www/html/ )
 3.go to any server any search : http://our_public_ip
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*S3
features :
-Bucket Versioning : used to store same name of object/file.
-Static website host : to host a static (simple) website.
-CRR (cross region replication) : Used to fast access data from another region ,we 
 create a new bucket for a new region.

*SUBNET : 
 -Subnet is a part of VPCs. 
 -It can be multiple subnet of a single VPCs.

*ROUT TABLE :

*INTERNET GET WAY (IGW): 
 -Used for public subnet .
 -High scalable ,It allows multiple inbound & out bound requests.

*NAT (Network address translation) GET WAY (NATGW): 
 -Used for private subnet/server.
 -It hides the ip of private server. 
 -PS->NATGW->internet (it is like a identity hider between internet & server).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18/12/2024

*NACL (NETWORK ACCESS CONTROL LIST) :
 It is like a security group but it is at subnet level ,and security group is at
 instance level.
